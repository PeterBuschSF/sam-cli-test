I've been having difficulty using SAM CLI within my company's Gitlab CICD runners.

I created this project to test out running SAM CLI in a simulated Docker-In-Docker environment.

This is to help validate if the problems I'm having are related to issues in the Gitlab CICD runners, or if SAM CLI has issues running in a Docker-In-Docker environment.
